# BBS-ISS-Prototype-DMU

A working proof-of-concept Python prototype for a **Privacy-Preserving Verifiable Credential System** utilizing **BBS+ signatures and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**. Originally designed within the context of higher education institutions, this project enables individuals (Holders) to obtain digital credentials from organizations (Issuers) and selectively prove statements about their identity to third parties (Verifiers) while prioritizing data minimization and privacy. Built on top of the [`ursa_bbs_signatures`](https://pypi.org/project/ursa-bbs-signatures/) library, the prototype demonstrates a complete, secure credential lifecycle: multi-round blind issuance with Pedersen commitments, verifiable presentation generation with cryptographic binding, seamless credential re-issuance, and foundational revocation mechanics.

## Protocol Overview

The blind issuance protocol proceeds in four rounds between the **Holder** and the **Issuer**:

```
Holder                                        Issuer
  │                                              │
  │──── 1. VCIssuanceRequest ───────────────────>│
  │                                              │
  │<─── 2. FreshnessUpdateResponse (nonce) ──────│
  │                                              │
  │──── 3. BlindSignRequest ────────────────────>│
  │     (commitment, proof, revealed attrs)      │

```

### Registry Protocol (Authority Synchronization)

The Registry acts as an authoritative source for Issuer public data. Entities maintain a local `PublicDataCache` and synchronize with the Registry using a "Cache-First" strategy.

**Asynchronous Resolution:** Both the Holder and Verifier implement an asynchronous "Pending" state. If an interaction requires issuer metadata not present in the local cache, the entity suspends the current flow, returns a `GetIssuerDetailsRequest`, and automatically resumes the interaction upon receiving and processing the authoritative `IssuerDetailsResponse`.

```
Entity (Holder/Verifier)                         Registry
  │                                              │
  ├── check local cache (miss) ──┐               │
  │                              │               │
  ├── suspend interaction <──────┘               │
  │                                              │
  │──── 1. GetIssuerDetailsRequest ─────────────>│
  │                                              ├── lookup issuer metadata
  │<─── 2. IssuerDetailsResponse (metadata) ─────│
  │                                              │
  ├── update local cache                         │
  └── resume suspended interaction               │
```

**Issuer Registration:** Issuers proactively announce their metadata (Public Key, Epoch configuration, Revocation status bitstring) to the Registry via `RegisterIssuerDetailsRequest`.

---

### Protocol Error Handling

To ensure protocol stability and prevent entities from hanging in "Waiting" states during failures, the prototype implements an explicit **Error Response** mechanism. Instead of relying solely on unhandled runtime exceptions, the `IssuerInstance` catches internal errors (e.g., bitstring exhaustion, proof invalidity, or state violations) and returns a structured `ErrorResponse`.

#### Error Categories

| Error Type | Description | Trigger |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `ISSUER_UNAVAILABLE` | Issuer is busy processing another request | Concurrent `ISSUANCE` or `RE_ISSUANCE` starts |
| `VERIFICATION_FAILED` | Cryptographic proof or signature validation failed | Tampered PoK, invalid VP, or broken commitments |
| `BITSTRING_EXHAUSTED` | No available indices in the revocation bitstring | Issuer capacity exceeded and no expired bits reclaimable |
| `INVALID_REQUEST` | The request payload contains invalid data | Attribute mismatches, missing validity fields, or malformed data |
| `INVALID_STATE` | The request arrived in an unexpected protocol state | Out-of-order messages (e.g., `BLIND_SIGN` without `ISSUANCE`) |

When an `ErrorResponse` is received, both the Holder and Verifier automatically call `end_interaction()` to reset their internal state machines, ensuring they are immediately available for subsequent interactions.

---

**Step 1 — Issuance Request:** The Holder initiates the protocol by sending a `VCIssuanceRequest`. Internally, the Holder stores the public key, attributes, and credential name in its local state.

**Step 2 — Freshness Response:** The Issuer generates a random 32-byte nonce and returns it as a `FreshnessUpdateResponse`. This value binds the commitment to a specific session, preventing replay attacks.

**Step 3 — Blind Sign Request:** The Holder builds a Pedersen commitment over its blinded attributes using the Issuer's nonce and public key. This step automatically appends three essential revealed metadata attributes: `metaHash` (which deterministically hashes the credential's contextual metadata), `validUntil` (expiration timestamp), and `revocationMaterial` (a hex-encoded bitstring index for future revocation checks). It sends a `BlindSignRequest` containing the commitment, a zero-knowledge proof of correct commitment construction, the revealed attributes, and their indices.

**Step 4 — Forward VC Response:** The Issuer first pre-computes the `VerifiableCredential` skeleton from the revealed and blinded attribute indices, then re-calculates the `metaHash` on the constructed VC and overwrites the placeholder value in both the VC and the signing request. It then verifies the blinded commitment proof. If valid, it computes a blind BBS+ signature over the commitment and the revealed attributes, attaches the signature to the VC, and returns it as a `ForwardVCResponse`.

The Holder then unblinds the signature using its stored blinding factor, fills in the blinded attribute values, re-verifies the signature against the full attribute set (including a freshly re-computed `metaHash`), and stores the credential.

---

### Presentation Protocol (Holder ↔ Verifier)

The selective disclosure protocol enables the Holder to present a verifiable subset of attributes to a Verifier using a zero-knowledge proof without revealing blinded attributes (such as link secrets) or any non-requested attributes.

```
Verifier                                      Holder
  │                                              │
  │──── 1. VPRequest ───────────────────────────>│
  │     (requested attrs, challenge nonce)       │
  │                                              ├── resolve credential
  │                                              ├── verify attribute availability
  │                                              ├── prevent hidden key conflict
  │                                              ├── build Verifiable Presentation
  │                                              ├── derive ZKP proof over bound nonce
  │<─── 2. ForwardVPResponse ────────────────────│
  │     (VP, issuer_pub_key)                     │
  ├── verify attribute completeness              │
  ├── verify BBS+ ZKP                            │
  └── extract revealed attributes                │
```

**Step 1 — VP Request:** The Verifier initiates a presentation by generating a random challenge nonce and sending a `VPRequest` specifying the list of attribute keys it requires.

**Step 2 — Forward VP Response:** The Holder receives the request and resolves the target credential. It ensures all requested attributes are present and none conflict with application-enforced hidden keys (e.g., link secrets). It builds a `VerifiablePresentation` containing only the requested subset. 

To prevent replay attacks and ensure cryptographic binding to the credential envelope, the Holder hashes the VP's envelope with the Verifier's original challenge nonce to derive a **bound nonce**. It then computes a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) over the original BBS+ signature, utilizing the bound nonce, and attaches the proof to the VP. The VP is returned in a `ForwardVPResponse`.

**Step 3 — Verification:** The Verifier first checks **Attribute Completeness** to ensure the Holder didn't omit required fields. It then reconstructs the **bound nonce** identically to the Holder and verifies the ZKP. If successful, the Verifier safely extracts the revealed attributes.

---

### Re-issuance Protocol (Holder ↔ Issuer)

The re-issuance protocol allows a Holder to request a renewed credential (e.g., updating the `validUntil` timestamp) while proving possession of their original credential via a Verifiable Presentation. This effectively binds the presentation of the old credential to the request for the new one.

```
Issuer                                        Holder
  │                                              │
  │<─── 1. Re-issuance Request ──────────────────│
  │                                              │
  │──── 2. FreshnessUpdateResponse (nonce) ─────>│
  │                                              │
  │<─── 3. ForwardVpAndCmtRequest ───────────────│
  │     (VP of old VC, new commitment)           │
  ├── verify VP & old VC validity                │
  ├── verify commitment proof (bound to nonce)   │
  ├── compute blind signature for new VC         │
  │──── 4. ForwardVCResponse (new VC) ──────────>│
  │                                              │
  │                                              ├── unblind new signature
  │                                              ├── verify new signature
  │                                              └── store new credential
```

**Step 1 — Re-issuance Request:** The Holder initiates the process specifying the target credential and the attributes that must remain hidden.

**Step 2 — Freshness Response:** The Issuer generates a challenge nonce for the session.

**Step 3 — Forward VP & Commitment:** The Holder generates a zero-knowledge proof (VP) of the old credential. It also generates a *new* blinded Pedersen commitment over its secret attributes (using the *same* challenge nonce). Both the VP and the new commitment are bundled into a `ForwardVpAndCmtRequest` and sent to the Issuer.

**Step 4 — New VC Response:** The Issuer verifies the VP (proving possession and validity of the old credential), checks the re-issuance window and revocation status, and verifies the new commitment proof against the same nonce. If valid, the Issuer issues a new Verifiable Credential with updated metadata (e.g., `validUntil`) and returns it. The Holder then unblinds and stores the renewed credential.

---

### Epoch-Based Expiration Logic

To prevent timeline-based correlation attacks (where attackers track users across platforms by their unique credential expiration timestamps), this prototype implements strict **Epoch-Based Validity**. 

- **Global Alignment:** Rather than calculating expiration dynamically (e.g., `now + duration`), the system calculates distance from a rigid, system-wide `baseline_date`. All credentials issued within the same cycle expire on the exact same second, granting users absolute temporal anonymity.
- **Window Bumping:** If a credential is issued or re-issued close to an upcoming boundary (specifically, within the configured `re_issuance_window_days`), the logic automatically rolls the expiration forward by one full epoch. This elegantly ensures holders are never issued a credential that is already legally "about to expire", while naturally facilitating early/on-time re-issuances without requiring inspection of their previous credential.

| `unblind_verify_save_vc(vc)` | `VerifiableCredential` | `bool` | Checks `unblind_ready`, unblinds the signature, fills in blinded attribute values in the VC, verifies the signature via `verify_vc()`, stores the credential alongside the issuer public key, clears interaction state, and returns the verification result. Raises `HolderStateError` if preconditions are not met, or `ProofValidityError` if signature verification fails. |

Resolves the credential, builds the VP envelope via `from_verifiable_credential()`, tags ProofMessages as `Revealed` or `Hidden`, derives the bound nonce (optionally hashing in a new `commitment`), and runs `bbs.create_proof()`. |
| `present_credential(vp_request, vc_name, always_hidden_keys=None)` | `VPRequest`, `str`, optional `list[str]` | `ForwardVPResponse` | High-level API for responding to a verifier. Checks attribute availability, ensures no conflict with `always_hidden_keys`, delegates to `build_vp()`, and returns the `ForwardVPResponse`. |
| `get_issuer_details(issuer_name)` | `str` | `IssuerPublicData \| GetIssuerDetailsRequest` | Cache-first lookup. Returns metadata immediately on hit, or triggers a registry lookup on miss. |
| `fetch_all_issuer_details()` | — | `BulkGetIssuerDetailsRequest` | Triggers a full synchronization of the local cache with the registry. |

#### `VerifierInstance`

**Module:** `bbs_iss.entities.verifier`

The Verifier initiates presentation requests, issues challenge nonces, and cryptographically verifies the resulting zero-knowledge proofs.

##### Inner Class: `VerifierInstance.State`

Tracks whether the Verifier is currently waiting for a presentation.

| Attribute    | Type           | Description                                           |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `awaiting`  | `bool`         | `True` while waiting for a VP response                |
| `freshness` | `bytes \| None`| The challenge nonce issued to the Holder              |
| `attributes`| `list[str] \| None`| The list of attributes requested                      |
| `type`      | `RequestType \| None` | Tracking the active request type (`VP_REQUEST`) |
| `queued_response`| `ForwardVPResponse \| None`| A VP parked while awaiting issuer resolution |

| Method / Property                               | Description                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `start_vp_request(nonce, attributes)`           | Sets all state fields, marks as awaiting       |
| `end_interaction()`                             | Clears all state fields, marks as available    |
| `available` *(property)*                        | `True` when not awaiting                       |

##### `VerifierInstance` Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `__init__()` | — | — | Initializes empty state and a `public_data_cache`. |
| `presentation_request(requested_attributes)` | `list[str]` | `VPRequest` | Generates a 32-byte challenge nonce via `gen_nonce()`, saves it to state along with the required attributes, and returns a `VPRequest`. Raises `VerifierStateError` if already busy. |
| `process_request(request)` | `Request` | `tuple \| IssuerPublicData \| list[IssuerPublicData] \| GetIssuerDetailsRequest` | Main dispatch method. Routes `FORWARD_VP` responses to `verify_vp()` and registry responses to the `PublicDataCache`. Implements **Asynchronous Resolution**: if `FORWARD_VP` targets an unknown issuer, it parks the VP in `queued_response` and returns a `GetIssuerDetailsRequest`. It automatically resumes verification once the registry response is processed. |
| `verify_vp(vp, pub_key)` | `VerifiablePresentation`, `PublicKeyBLS` | `tuple[bool, dict \| None, VP]` | Two-phase verification. Phase 1 checks Attribute Completeness against the original `requested_attributes`. Phase 2 reconstructs the bound nonce and runs BBS+ `verify_proof()`. Returns `(is_valid, revealed_attributes, vp_object)`. |
| `get_issuer_details(issuer_name)` | `str` | `IssuerPublicData \| GetIssuerDetailsRequest` | Triggers authoritative metadata lookup. |

#### `credential`

**Module:** `bbs_iss.interfaces.credential`

##### `VerifiableCredential`

##### Class Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_CONTEXT` | `["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/bbs/v1"]` | Default JSON-LD `@context` |
| `DEFAULT_TYPE` | `["VerifiableCredential"]` | Base credential type (extended with `"MockCredential"` at instantiation) |
| `META_HASH_KEY` | `"metaHash"` | Key used in `credential_subject` for the metadata hash |
| `META_HASH_PLACEHOLDER` | `"PLACE-HOLDER-METAHASH"` | Placeholder value before `metaHash` is computed |

##### Instance Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `context` | `list[str]` | JSON-LD `@context` (defaults to `DEFAULT_CONTEXT`) |
| `type` | `list[str]` | Credential types (defaults to `["VerifiableCredential", "MockCredential"]`) |
| `issuer` | `str` | Issuer identifier |
| `credential_subject` | `dict[str, Any]` | Key-value map of credential attributes |
| `proof` | `bytes \| None` | The BBS+ signature bytes |

##### Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `to_dict()` | — | `dict` | Serializes to a W3C-style dictionary. Proof is hex-encoded. |
| `from_dict(data)` *(classmethod)* | `dict` | `VerifiableCredential` | Deserializes from a dictionary. |
| `to_json(indent=4)` | `int` | `str` | JSON serialization. |
| `from_json(json_str)` *(classmethod)* | `str` | `VerifiableCredential` | JSON deserialization. |
| `parse_sorted_keyed_indexed_messages(messages)` *(static)* | `list[KeyedIndexedMessage]` | `dict[str, str]` | Converts a list of `KeyedIndexedMessage` objects into a `{key: message}` dictionary, sorted by index. |
| `prepare_verification_request(pub_key)` | `PublicKeyBLS` | `bbs.VerifyRequest` | Builds a BBS+ `VerifyRequest` by copying the credential subject, re-computing the `metaHash` via `normalize_meta_fields()`, and assembling the message list with the issuer's public key and stored signature. |
| `normalize_meta_fields()` | — | `str` | Deterministically hashes the credential's metadata fields (`@context`, `type`, `issuer`, `credentialSubject` keys in insertion order, `proof` label) via incremental BLAKE2b (32-byte digest). Key order is preserved (not sorted) so that reordering attributes produces a different hash — this is required for BBS message-index binding. Returns the hex digest. |

##### `VerifiablePresentation`

##### Methods

| Method | Parameters | Returns | Description |
|--------|-----------|---------|-------------|

| `add_proof(proof)` | `bytes` | — | Sets the ZKP bytes on the embedded VC. |
| `normalize_meta_fields()` | — | `str` | Hashes the VP envelope and the embedded credential envelope (excluding variable proof values and the values of the revealed attributes, as they are protected by the ZKP). Provides deterministic data binding using BLAKE2b. |
| `build_bound_nonce(nonce, commitment=None)` | `bytes`, optional `bytes` | `bytes` | Produces an *effective nonce* by hashing the verifier's original challenge nonce with the output of `normalize_meta_fields()` (and optionally an embedded `commitment` for re-issuance flows). This cryptographically binds the metadata envelope and new commitment to the specific presentation session. |
| `prepare_verification_request(pub_key, nonce, commitment=None)` | `PublicKeyBLS`, `bytes`, optional `bytes` | `bbs.VerifyProofRequest` | Reconstructs the bound nonce and extracts revealed message values in order, producing the final request needed for the Verifier to execute `bbs.verify_proof`. |
| Serialization | `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`, `to_json()`, `from_json()` | — | Converts between python objects, dictionaries, and JSON strings, maintaining proper hex encoding of the ZKP proof. |

---

### Serialization & Debugging

To facilitate real-world data exchange across various mediums (HTTP, QR scans, etc.), all request and response objects implement standardized serialization:

- **JSON/Dict Support**: Every `Request` subclass supports `to_dict()`, `from_dict()`, `to_json()`, and `from_json()`. Binary fields (keys, proofs, commitments) are automatically hex-encoded.
- **Polymorphic Reconstruction**: The base `Request` class includes a factory `from_dict()` method. This enables the system to receive a generic JSON blob and automatically reconstruct the correct specific subclass (e.g., `BlindSignRequest`) based on the internal `request_type` discriminator.
- **Rich Pretty-Printing**: Each request class implements `get_print_string()`, providing a human-readable, bordered summary of its contents. Complex nested structures like `VerifiableCredential` and `VerifiablePresentation` are automatically pretty-printed using formatted JSON.
